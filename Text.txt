IDEAS TO ADD TO THE PROJECT!!!



------------------------------------------

Current issues:

Whenever i click a card in the previousCity.html page it only shows me weather data for the latest city added to cities array.

summary inclusion.

critical thinking and problem solving is coding, and that's the easy part for me, that's how my mind works. 
I identify issues and how to fix them but i found it difficult to iterate fixes and translate my thoughts into code.

p.s. just noticed something odd, whenever you upload files to github the case sensitivity stays; however, when uploading changes to netlify i noticed case sensivity change.
which wouldnt be an issue if i wasn't using .referrer (I think). just thought it would be worth mentioning/documenting.
